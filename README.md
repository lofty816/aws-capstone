# aws-capstone
This GitHub repository was made to help me host my AWS Capstone 2023 Capstone project. It will provide a complete breakdown of the steps that I took to get my project to function.


## Phase 1 Task 1 - Planning
The first step that was done was carefully planning out the services that were needed for this project. The guidelines I was following wanted me to have a Highly Availaible Web Application that included it being highly availiable, support random traffic spikes, low latency, load balanced and cost optimized. I was budgeted $100 for this project. To make sure I stayed within my budget, I used [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) to help me create a visual representation of my project. Once I figured out what services I was going to use, I headed over to [Amazons Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/) to help me guage the total pricing for all the services I have selected.

## Phase 2 Task 1 - Create a Functioning Web Application
Once I got to this phase, I went to the Amazon VPC Dashboard
